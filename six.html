            <dd>A puppy is a juvenile dog, generally one less than 12-18 months old.

                Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and dependent on their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality), but healthy puppies grow quickly and begin walking thereafter. Puppies generally weigh 8–16 oz (0.23–0.45 kg) shortly after birth, depending on the breed.[1]
                
                A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers specifically to young dogs,[2] while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.[3]</dd>

            <dd>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting—as well as body</dd>
