        The Dog is a domestic animal. It is most of the often-used animal as a pet. People prefer to have a dog as a pet rather than any other animal. The dog serves its master selflessly. All that it wants in return is love and care of the owner.

There are many breeds of dogs available in the world. Every breed has unique qualities and abilities different from the other. We can find the dogs all over the world. Some of them as a pet while some other wandering on the road. Some wild dogs live only in the forest.

        The dogs need an open, clean and secure environment to play and grow. They also need a healthy diet with fresh water. It can prevent them from illness and increase their life span. A banded dog tends to become irritable and unsocial. We must set them free most of the time. The regular exercise and timely visits to the doctor are the most important to keep them fit. Our care is their future.
